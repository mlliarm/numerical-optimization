# Numerical Optimization with SciPy

In this project me and my co-worker studied some algorithms of unconstrained optimization that are supported by SciPy.

Namely, from the Quasi-Newton methods BFGS & DFP, from the Conjugate Direction methods Conjugate Gradient, and from the methods of global optimization Nelder-Mead and Basin Hopping.

After the theoretical analysis an experimental process took place where we benchmarked the built-in SciPy methods using seven test functions for problems of unconstrained optimization taken from the paper of Jorge J. More et al "Testing Unconstrained Optimization Software". Finally there have been drawn conclusions regarding which method(s) perform better, in each function seperately.
